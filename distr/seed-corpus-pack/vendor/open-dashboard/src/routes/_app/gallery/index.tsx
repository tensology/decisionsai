/**
 * Skills Gallery Overview — the catalogue of admin UI shapes.
 *
 * Every shape below is a self-contained, zero-config demo route under
 * `src/routes/_app/gallery/*`. Each skill also has its own sidebar entry (under
 * the `Skills · …` groups); this Overview lists every shape — including the
 * variants not pinned to the sidebar — grouped into URL-synced tabs. The
 * business cases in the sidebar show these shapes *composed* into real products;
 * this page is the catalogue you pick from. It is repo-only proof — the
 * `scaffold-dashboard` base ships without it (`build-base` strips the gallery).
