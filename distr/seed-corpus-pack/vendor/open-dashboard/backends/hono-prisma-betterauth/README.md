# Preset: Hono + Prisma + better-auth (standalone TS service)

A **standalone, runnable backend service** for the open-dashboard frontend — the **Prisma
sibling of [`hono-drizzle-betterauth`](../hono-drizzle-betterauth)**. Same wire contract
([`../CONTRACT.md`](../CONTRACT.md)), same frontend wiring; only the ORM differs (Prisma
instead of Drizzle).

- **Data** — the `products` resource as a **json-server-dialect REST API**
  (`_page`/`_limit`/`_sort`/`_order`/`q`/`status` + an `X-Total-Count` header), backed by
  **Prisma Client**.
- **Auth** — **real better-auth** (email + password, **Prisma adapter**) hosted at
  `/api/auth/*` (CONTRACT §2b) — the same SDK + protocol the in-process default and the
  Drizzle sibling use, just on a separate origin.

It runs on the **Bun** runtime. Picking this preset means the dashboard's `products` data
comes from `restRepository` pointed here, and its auth is the shipped *remote* better-auth
adapter pointed here — **no page, query, table, or form in the frontend changes.**

## Zero-config posture

Mirrors the frontend's zero-config `bun dev` (CONTRACT §3):

- **No `DATABASE_URL`** → **SQLite** via Prisma (a local `dev.db` file).
  Tables are created automatically on boot — the `predev`/`prestart` scripts run
  `prisma db push` against `prisma/schema.prisma` (provider `sqlite`) **before** the server
  starts, so there is **no manual migrate step**. A dev account (`dev@example.com` /
  `password`) and a few sample products are seeded on first run. (`SQLITE_PATH` must be a
  real file — `prisma db push` runs in a separate process from the server, so an in-memory
  DB would not survive; for an ephemeral DB use a throwaway file you delete afterwards.)
- **`DATABASE_URL` set** → **Postgres** (the production path). `scripts/prisma.ts` swaps in
  the byte-identical `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma` (provider `postgresql`) for
  `generate` / `db push`; manage with `prisma migrate` in a real deployment.
- **`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`** — a clearly-labelled insecure dev fallback in non-production; in
  production the service **fails closed** (refuses to boot) if it is unset.

`bun install` runs `prisma generate` (postinstall); `bun run dev` / `bun run start` run
`prisma db push` (predev/prestart) before booting. The generated Prisma client and the
`*.db` files are **gitignored** — only `prisma/schema.prisma` (+ the Postgres variant) is
committed.

## Run

```bash
bun install      # also runs `prisma generate`
bun run dev      # http://localhost:8788  (zero-config SQLite, db push + hot reload)
# or:
bun run start    # db push, no hot reload
```

On Postgres:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set DATABASE_URL (+ BETTER_AUTH_SECRET for prod)
bun run start          # db push targets prisma/schema.postgres.prisma automatically
```

## Test

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun run test     # NOT `bun test` — `bun run test` fires the pretest hook (prisma db push)
```

The `pretest` hook runs `prisma generate` + `prisma db push` against a dedicated
`./test.db`; the suite (`test/contract.test.ts`) then exercises the contract end-to-end
with no transport mocks: register → sign-in → get-session round-trip; create → list with a
correct `X-Total-Count`; search / filter / sort / pagination; patch → get reflects the
change; delete → get → 404; plus 400/404 error paths and the sort-whitelist fallback.

## Environment variables

| Var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Postgres connection string. Unset → SQLite (zero-config); set → Postgres + the Postgres schema. |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | `./dev.db` | SQLite **file** when `DATABASE_URL` is unset. Must be a real file (not `:memory:`); for ephemeral use a throwaway file you delete. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | dev fallback (non-prod only) | Session-signing secret. **Required in production** (fails closed). |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | _(unset)_ | The origin this service is reached at (better-auth `baseURL`). Set in prod. |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:3000` | Dashboard origin — trusted for CORS + better-auth CSRF (`trustedOrigins`). |
| `DATA_API_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Optional bearer token guarding the **data** routes (`/products` only). Unset → open (dev). Set → every `/products` request needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. See **Securing the data API**. |
| `PORT` | `8788` | HTTP port (8788 so it does not clash with the Drizzle preset's 8787). |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/products` | List. Params `_page` `_limit` `_sort` `_order` `q` `status`; returns a JSON array + `X-Total-Count`. |
| `GET` | `/products/:id` | Read one. `404` when absent. |
| `POST` | `/products` | Create. `201` with the new record; `400` on validation failure. |
| `PATCH` | `/products/:id` | Partial update. `200`; `404` when absent. |
| `DELETE` | `/products/:id` | Delete. `204`; `404` when absent. |
| `*` | `/api/auth/*` | better-auth (`/sign-up/email`, `/sign-in/email`, `/sign-out`, `/get-session`). |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness. |

Sortable whitelist: `name` `category` `price` `stock` `createdAt` (default `createdAt`
desc). Searchable (`q`, case-insensitive OR): `name` `sku` `category`. Filterable (exact):
`status` ∈ `available` `out_of_stock` `discontinued`. Raw user input is never used as a
sort/filter column. `_limit` is capped at **100**.

## Securing the data API

> **The `/products` data routes are unauthenticated by default.** They trust their
> network: anyone who can reach this service's port can read and write products. This is
> fine for local dev and for a private network where only the dashboard's server-side
> code can reach the service (the default deployment — CONTRACT §1 has the frontend call
> the data API over a trusted server-to-server hop, no auth header). **It is not safe to
> expose the port publicly as-is.**

For production, set **`DATA_API_TOKEN`** (a strong random value, e.g.
`openssl rand -base64 32`). When it is set, every `/products` request must carry
`Authorization: Bearer <DATA_API_TOKEN>`; a missing or wrong token gets `401`
`{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`. The auth routes (`/api/auth/*`) are **not** gated by this —
they have their own auth.

Have the dashboard frontend forward the token from its server-side `restRepository` binding:

```ts
const repo = restRepository<Product, ProductInput, Product>({
  baseUrl: process.env.PRODUCTS_API_URL!,
  path: "/products",
  map: (raw) => raw,
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DATA_API_TOKEN!}` },
});
```

The token lives only in server-side env on both sides — it never reaches the browser.

## Frontend wiring

**Identical to [`hono-drizzle-betterauth`](../hono-drizzle-betterauth/README.md#frontend-wiring)** —
both presets speak the same wire contract (json-server REST + remote better-auth, CONTRACT
§2b), so the dashboard wiring does not depend on which ORM the service uses. The dashboard
reaches this service through its two seams — **no UI code changes**, only the two adapter
bindings + env vars. Let `SERVICE = http://localhost:8788` (this service's origin).

### Env vars (in the frontend project)

```bash
# .env in the dashboard repo
PRODUCTS_API_URL=http://localhost:8788   # this service's origin (server-only)
AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8788    # same origin; better-auth lives at /api/auth/*
```

This service also needs `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` so its CORS +
`trustedOrigins` admit the dashboard.

### Data — bind `products` to `restRepository`

In the frontend's `src/features/products/server.ts`, replace the `drizzleRepository`
binding with `restRepository` pointed at this service. The **defaults already match** this
service's json-server dialect (`_page`/`_limit`/`_sort`/`_order`/`q` + `x-total-count`), so
no `params`/`totalHeader` override is needed — the `status` filter passes through as the
`status` query param, which `restRepository` already forwards from `params.filters`:

```ts
import { restRepository } from "@/infra/data/rest-repository";
import type { Product } from "./schema";

const repo = restRepository<Product, ProductInput, Product>({
  baseUrl: process.env.PRODUCTS_API_URL!, // http://localhost:8788
  path: "/products",
  map: (raw) => raw,        // wire shape already equals Product
  // serialize defaults to identity; ProductInput maps 1:1 to the request body.
});
```

The `list*/get*/create*/update*/delete*` server fns keep calling `repo.*` exactly as they
do for Drizzle. Because the fetch runs inside a server fn that has already called
`requireUser()`, no auth header is sent on data calls (CONTRACT §1).

### Auth — activate the shipped remote better-auth `AuthProvider` (CONTRACT §2b)

This service hosts the *same* better-auth protocol as the in-process default and the
Drizzle sibling, so the frontend wiring is the **same** thin **remote** adapter that already
ships — typechecked — in the scaffold base
(`src/lib/auth-providers/remote-better-auth.ts`). You only activate it:

1. Point the auth seam at the shipped provider:

   ```ts
   // src/lib/auth-provider.ts
   import { remoteBetterAuthProvider } from "@/lib/auth-providers/remote-better-auth";
   export const authProvider: AuthProvider = remoteBetterAuthProvider;
   ```

2. Set `AUTH_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8788` (this service's origin).

3. **Keep `src/lib/auth-client.ts` as-is** (proxy mode): the browser hits the dashboard's
   own same-origin `/api/auth/*`, and `remoteBetterAuthProvider.handler` proxies to the
   service, forwarding method/headers/body and rewriting upstream `Set-Cookie` to host-only
   (drops `Domain`) so the session cookie lands on the dashboard origin. `getSession` → the
   remote `/api/auth/get-session`. `_app.tsx`/`requireUser()` unchanged.

   (Direct cross-origin mode is optional: point the better-auth client's `baseURL` at the
   service via `VITE_BETTER_AUTH_URL` and skip the proxy — needs CORS + cross-site cookies.)

The service's `trustedOrigins` (from `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`) must include the dashboard origin so
CSRF + CORS admit these calls.
