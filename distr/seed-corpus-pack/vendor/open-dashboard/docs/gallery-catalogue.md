# Gallery catalogue

> The **Skills Gallery** is **repo-only proof**: a rich palette of working shapes
> the substrate typechecks/builds/tests/renders, so each shape is the live evidence
> its `add-component` reference produces working UI. It is **stripped from the
> scaffold base** by `build-base` — a scaffolded product starts gallery-free and
> **adds** the shapes it needs from `add-component`. All variants below are
> **built, green (typecheck/check/test/build), and zero-config runnable** — each is
> a self-contained route under `src/routes/_app/gallery/`, surfaced both by the
> tabbed **`Skills Gallery · Overview`** (`/gallery`, `gallery/index.tsx`) and by a
> per-shape sidebar entry under the `Skills · …` groups.
>
> **Where the shapes live as skills.** Every UI shape below is a **component in the
> single `add-component` skill** — its reference doc is
> `.claude/skills/add-component/references/<name>.md` and its copy-ready template is
> under `.claude/skills/add-component/templates/`. The component identifiers
> (`add-form`, `add-kanban`, …) live on as those reference docs; they are no longer
> standalone skill directories. The handful of names that remain **standalone
> skills** (`add-backend`, …) are
> called out as such in the rows below.
>
> The sidebar's two **business-case groups** (E-commerce, Sales/CRM) **compose**
> these shapes into real back-offices — see the "Business cases" section of
> `CLAUDE.md`.

Legend: ✅ built & verified · the **Skill / component** column names either a
standalone `add-*` skill or a component (reference doc) inside `add-component`.

## The 3 hard rules (every variant must obey these, or the gallery hurts the agent)

1. **Same conventions as everything else.** `ListParams` shape, `Repository` +
   `AuthProvider` seams, query keys `["<res>","list",params]`, URL-synced state,
   explicit loading / empty / error. Consistency beats count (ROADMAP #2).
2. **Self-contained + independently strippable.** One route (+ one `features/<name>/`
   folder if it has data). Deleting it touches nothing else — this is what lets
   `build-base` drop the whole gallery from the scaffold base cleanly.
3. **Every variant is addable** — via a standalone `add-*` skill or, for the UI
   shapes, via its component reference doc in `add-component` — and has a catalogue
   row. If an agent can't add it, it isn't done (ROADMAP #6).

All variants run **zero-config** on the in-memory backend (`memoryRepository` +
better-auth memory adapter), so the whole gallery works on `bun dev` with no DB.

## Cross-cutting options (composable modifiers, defined once, reused everywhere)

These are **not** separate pages — they are toggles a list/form variant can turn
on. Each is documented once and demonstrated by ≥1 variant below.

| Option | Meaning | Demonstrated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `paginated` | server-side page/pageSize controls | Data table |
| `infinite` | load-more / infinite scroll, no pager | Infinite list |
| `lazy` | defer-load on viewport / on expand | Lazy list, Tabbed detail |
| `searchable` | debounced search box wired to `ListParams.search` | Data table, Combobox |
| `filterable` | faceted filters → `ListParams.filters` | Data table |
| `selectable` | row selection + bulk actions (transient local state) | Table bulk select |
| `sortable` | column/sort controls → `ListParams.sortBy/Dir` | Data table |
| `custom-actions` | configurable toolbar / row / footer buttons | Action toolbar |
| `scroll` vs `fixed` | scrollable body w/ sticky header/footer **vs** fit-to-viewport | Scroll form / Fixed form |
| `density` | comfortable / compact (lite) row height | List view (lite) |

## Skills plan

- **One `add-component` catalogue.** The 35+ UI shapes above are components inside
  the single `add-component` skill — each with a reference doc
  (`.claude/skills/add-component/references/<name>.md`) carrying the
  add-it / foundation / invariants / verify steps, plus its template under
  `.claude/skills/add-component/templates/`. The gallery itself is repo-only proof
  and is stripped from the scaffold base by `build-base` (no per-shape `remove-*`
  skill).
- **Standalone operation skills** stay their own directories: `scaffold-dashboard`,
  `add-backend`, `rebrand`.
- **Options as composable docs**: pagination / infinite / lazy / searchable /
  filterable / selectable / custom-actions / scroll-vs-fixed are documented once
  in `add-component` and referenced by each component, not re-explained per variant.

## Stripped from the scaffold base

The gallery is repo-only proof: it ships in this substrate so every shape is
verified and visible, but it is **not** part of the product base. `build-base`
strips it when assembling the `scaffold-dashboard` bundle — it drops the
`gallery/*` routes, the `SHAPES` array in `gallery/index.tsx`, and the
`Skills Gallery` + all `Skills · …` sidebar groups. A scaffolded product therefore
starts gallery-free and **composes** the shapes it needs from `add-component`. To
explore the shapes live, `git clone` the full repo and run `bun dev`, then build
your product in a fresh scaffold.

## Suggested build order (each phase ends zero-config-green + signed off)

1. **Forms** (most variants, sets the option-toggle conventions): full-page,
   scroll, fixed, wizard, field-array, custom-actions, combobox.
2. **Lists** (most-used): list-lite, infinite, lazy, virtual table, inline-edit.
3. **Pages**: control/settings, profile, empty-state, split-layout.
4. **Rich lists**: kanban, tree, calendar, timeline.
5. **Display + feedback blocks**: drawer, state-kit, tag/metadata/avatar, banners.

---

## Decisions taken

- **Scope**: build everything, including the heavy views (kanban / tree / calendar
  / timeline). Done.
- **Sidebar**: the **Skills Gallery** — a `Skills Gallery · Overview` entry (the
  tabbed catalogue, `gallery/index.tsx` / the `SHAPES` array) plus one entry per
  skill under the `Skills · …` groups.
- **Routes**: all gallery demos nested under `src/routes/_app/gallery/*` (+ a few
  components under `src/components/{data,feedback}` and `ComboboxField.tsx`), so the
  whole gallery strips as a unit from the scaffold base via `build-base`.
- **Skills**: every shape is a component in the single `add-component` skill (see
  `.claude/skills/add-component/` — one `references/<name>.md` + template per
  shape); the gallery is stripped from the scaffold base by `build-base`. Structure
  documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
